// react is a lib for building userinterfaces  : helps  define UI : once and for all .
so when the state of app changes : UI rebuilt . // nothing extra 
hence no more hunting for DOM nodes 
: just maintain state of your app 

so just one library : and you can create 

1.web apps
2.Native iOS and Android apps
3.Canvas apps
4.TV apps
5. Native desktop apps


hence learn react to focus only on the thing that makes your app different
