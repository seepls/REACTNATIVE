you define where your application should be placed on the page  <div id = "app"> ... </div>

you can always mix regular HTML content as well as other JS libraries 
can also have several react React apps on the same page .


React object : all API accesible through this , and they are less
ReactDOM object : render() most useful 

you build your app using components , build your UI using components .

document.getElementById("app") 

used to tell React where the application should be located in the page 


DOM--- React : bridge 
React does the translation from components to underlying platform 

always render one top-level component and it can have as many children components .


React.DOM.*
can use a number of HTML elements as react components via React.DOM object 


ReactDOM on the other hand is a way to render the app in the browser
