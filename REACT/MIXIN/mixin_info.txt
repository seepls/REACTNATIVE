concept for resuing code : mixin

- mixin is a JS object that contains a collection of methods and properties 
- not meant to be used on its own , included into another object's properties 


 in react world : the mixin property 
 
 var MyComponent = React.createClass({
 mixins : [ obj1,obj2,obj3],
 //rest of the methods 
 };
 
 assign array of JS objects to mixins property and react takes care of the rest
