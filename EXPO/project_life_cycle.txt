 in deploying locally :
 
 When you work on an Expo project, we serve an instance of your project from your local computer. 
 If you close the project or turn off your computer, your development project stops being served.
 
 
 It asks your computer for a local copy of your project (via localhost, LAN, or a tunnel), downloads it, and runs it. 
 tools such as debugging, streaming device logs, inspecting elements, hot module reloading, and more.
