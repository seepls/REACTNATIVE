two tools needed in order to develope an app with EXPO 
- a local development tool
- mobile client to open your app 


local development tool :
Expo CLI : ( command line interface )

has CLI and GUI

With Expo Dev Tools you can quickly set up your test devices, view logs and more.
When you serve your project with Expo CLI, it generates a development URL that you can open in Expo Client to preview your app. 

also need to install watchman :
 Watchman watches files and records when they change, then triggers actions in response to this, 
 and it's used internally by React Native.
