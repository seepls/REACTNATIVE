:::what is react native ?

React Native : java script framework .

based on react : facebook's JavaScript library for building user interfaces .
Similar to react for web . react native applications are written : mixture of 
1.javascript 2.XML-esque markup :: JSX

react native bridge : envokes native rendering APIs in ObjectiveC or JAVA
hence my application will render using real mobile UI component 

reactnative exposes javascript interfaces for platform APIs , so that the app can access platform features like , camera or user's location

::: Advantages of reactnative :

-reactnative renders using its host platform standard rendering API :: distingueshes it from Cordova or Ionic 
- it actually translates your markup to real , native UI elements , maximising existing means of rendering views on whateer platform you are working with 
- react works separately from the main UI thread . 
- update cycle in reactNative same as react : when props or state change , reactnative rerenders the views .

::: difference 
major difference : reactnative does all this by maximizing the usage of the UI libraires of the host rather than HTML and CSS markup

react native improvement over normal mobile app development : developer experience and cross-platform development potential
